When I read the book "Why Americans Hate Welfare" back in college, it had a deep impact on my view of the world and it has continued to influence my thinking ever since. The author, Martin Gilens, presents data from a multitude of sources to build three main arguments. First, Americans generally want to help poor people. Second, since the 1960s, there has been an increasingly strong divide between what Americans consider deserving and undeserving poor people. Third, media coverage contributed signficantly during the period from 1960-1980 to crystallize the sterotype of blacks as undeserving (either because of poor individual choices, a culture that doesn't support hard work, or some combination of the two). Thus on one hand, the answer is simple: Americans hate welfare because they hold racist, anti-black opinions. In the book's conclusion, Gilens, softens this point of view and says that despite the toxic mix of racism and anti-welfare points of view, most Americans still want to help; Gilens ultimately points the finger at a policy and electoral system that prevents the country's lawmakers from accurately representing the people's wish to help. ??? quote ???

"Why Americans Hate Welfare" is not a complicated book compared to a lot of social science published in academic journals. Every chapter presents a handful of charts and tables. They often summarize public opinion polling from a multitude of sources. (One chapter rellies heavily on data collected by the author as he reviewed newspaper, magazing, and TV images from stories about poverty.) When the analyses use regressions or more complicated models, the details are placed in appendices. The effect makes for compelling reading.

The book came out in 1999, just after the [1996 welfare reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Responsibility_and_Work_Opportunity_Act) act took effect. Gilens mentions welfare reform, but doesn't attempt to test if it had any significant effects on the trends he described. There simply wasn't enough post-reform data to draw any useful conclusions at the time. However, the 1996 welfare reform act is only one of the myriad changes that took place in the past twenty years. Condsider the events since 1999:

- post-9/11 economic recession
- Afghanistan and Iraq wars
- Katrina
- housing boom
- technologies such as cable news, Google, iPhone, Facebook
- the decline of print media and traditional broadcast news
- housing market collapse
- Great Recession
- election of a black president
- rise of the Tea Party
- Black Lives Matter protests
- multiple waves of immigration debates
- election of Donald Trump, a political noephyte, to president

Also consider some new and continuing socio-economic trends since 1999:
- changing demographic makeup of US and specifically US cities
- continued de-industrialization (now automation)
- increased number of jobs requiring college degrees
- levelling off of racial integration in neighborhoods, schools, businesses, etc.
- increased ??? assortative mating
- stagnate wages
- increasingly precarious retirements
- increase in for-profit colleges
- decline in ratio of wages to housing costs
- accelerated financialization and Wall-Street-ification of the economy
- life expectancy for white males is not good (Deaton)

Not to mention the federal policy changes since 1999. Notably missing from this list is any large-scale welfare policy changes, but many of these policies had the largest effect in the slice of the population usually thought of as welfare recipients:
- Too big to fail for banks
- No Child Left Behind
- Medicare Part D
- Obamacare
- extensions to unemployment insurance after the Great Recession
- basically no changes to TANF
- SNAP expanded during Great Recession but not because of policy changes
- cuts in state and local government social service programs after 2009

With all of these things in mind I thought it would be a good idea to re-analyze the data from "Why Americans Hate Welfare." There are many ways to look at race, media, and welfare policy; Gilens isn't the only author or social scientist working on these topics. To keep this project within a managable scope, I'm not planning to develop any new arguments. I grant that Gilens basically got the argument correct back in 1999, and I want to see what, if anything, has changed since then.

I am working on this as a side project from my 9 to 5 as part of the #cnc2018 challenge. Besides doing some -- hopefully -- important social science, I want to use this as an opportunity to level up my own skills in data analysis and work-flow management. My previous work has often concentrated on building novel datasets or implementing very complicated statistical models (or both). I think this project is ideal because it is non-trivial, yet it will focus more on gathering a lot of existing data sources and analyzing them with more simple approaches. It should allow me to focus more on aspects of writing clean, reproducible code that can generate compelling data visualizations. Each visualization will feed in to the overall narative, which has already been described by the origianl book. So my plan for every graph and table that appears in "Why Americans Hate Welfare" will be some version of:

1. Find the original data.
2. Reproduce the figure as printed in the book.
3. Find data from the same source that covers the period from 1999 to the present.
4. Produce a figure that extends the original up till today.
5. Write a paragraph or two explaining what changed or stayed the same.

In some cases -- especialy for chapter ??? where Gilens coded media content -- the data may not be available. When that happens, I will skip it and move on. Maybe a second iteration through this project will take up the more extensive task of finding alternative, but comparable, data sources.
